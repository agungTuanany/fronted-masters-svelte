Time to move onto the fun stuff. We're going to make a game using data from
{fn-cameo_com}[cameo.com,window=_blank], an amazing website that lets you pay
celebrities to record 30 second personalised videos. You can get the "Insane
Clown Posse" to roast your friends or wish your spouse a happy anniversary.

The game is called {fn-cameoparison}[CameoParison,window=_blank], and the goal
is to guess which celebrities are expensive, and which ones are cheap. Since
there's no official API, we'll grab data from
{fn-cameo_explorer}[cameo-explorer.netlify.app,window=_blank], which contains
a scraped snapshot of some of the top celebs.

We'll start by cloning the starter repo:

// {{{ $ git clone git@github.com:Rich-Harris/cameoparison-starter.git
[source, bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:Rich-Harris/cameoparison-starter.git
----
// }}}

This is almost identical to the default project template, with the addition of
a couple of image files and some extra `"src"` modules to save time later.

It also has several *branches* that you can check out if you get stuck following
the course and need to get back on track:

- checkpoint-1
- checkpoint-2
- checkpoint-3
- complete

As you follow along, make your changes in the master branch.
