Welcome friends and enemies to the first ever front-end mastery Svelte
workshop. I'm your instructor Rich and we've got a full day  ahead of us, I
hope you're ready.

I am going to be reading from this website which is
{fn-netlify}[svelte-workshop,window=_blank] I recommend
that you open that website on your own browser, because it contains useful
links that are going to be working through as the course progress.

After the course ends, this is going to live on as a companion resource that
lives on {fn-pr}[GitHub,window=_blank]. So issues and pull request (PR) are welcome.

If there any changes or nay fixes you spot that need making; and but other that
that let's get into it.

So about this Workshop, the idea is that we're going to go from assuming that
you have absolutely No knowledge about Svelte whatsoever. So being able to
build a full dynamically *server rendered* progressively enhanced personalized
interactive application, and we are going to deploy that all in the space of a
few hours.

It's going to happen in *four* parts. We're going to have the:

- Introduction, where I'm going to explain what Svelte is, why you might
  consider using it.
- Then we're going to have a series of *short interactive exercises*. So that
  you become familiar with the syntax of "Svelte - Component", and  what
  features Svelte has,
- Then from there we're going to use that knowledge to  *building a simple
  game*.
- Then finally, the main part of the course we're going *building a complete
  app* I mentioned.

It's a lot to get through, but I think we can do it.

=== About Me

So who am I?

I'm the creator of Svelte. I created back in *2016*, a lifetime a go. My job in
the news business.  I have spent my life, my adult life working in news
organizations using JavaScript to help tell stories in ways that are more
interactive and data boom.

Right now I'm member of the "New York Times" Graphic - Department. That the day
job by night.

I prowled the streets of get her committing acts of Open Source. And I'm on
Twitter  {fn-rich_twitter}[@rich_harris,window=_blank] and message
me and learn more about Svelte.

=== Acknowledgement

Want to take a *QUICK* moment to thank everyone involved in producing this
course. Mark, and the whole team at Front-end Mastery. I want to thank our
friends at coach Smith who providing the space that we're right now.

This Svelte community of users and contributors or Svelte - Society as we call
ourselves. Or if you're fan of the Svelte, a loader and I want to Thank to you
for being here.

=== Housekeeping

Little bit of housekeeping. I am going to be using "Visual Code" is a very
popular editor if you're not using it, highly recommend it. There's a download
link on the website {fn-vscode}[visualstudio,window=_blank], and we're going to
need to install {fn-svelte_beta}[Svelte-beta,window=_blank]
- extension that provides syntax - highlighting, and also completion and all
the rest of it.

NOTE: Not the one that's just called *"Svelte"*, that the one is *deprecated*.
The current is "Svelte-Beta" and that is going to take over.

For final part of this workshop, we're going to be using some free online
services that you will need to sign up, for the first is

- {fn-fauna}[fauna,window=_blank] (which is a cloud database)
- {fn-auth0}[Auth0,window=_blank] (for authentication)
- {fn-weatherbit}[Weatherbit,window=_blank] (this one takes a little while to
  prevision API - Keys, so don't wait until you need it!)
- {fn-vercel}[Vercel,window=_blank] (optional - so that you can deploy your
  app).  You'll also nee to install (or update) the Vercel - CLI globally with
  `npm i -g vercel`.
